            I don't mind
            Letting you down easy, but just give it time
            If it don't hurt now, well, just wait, just wait a while
            You're not the big fish in the pond no more
            You are what they're feeding on

            Ain't it fun
            Living in the real world?
            Ain't it good
            Being all alone?
            Where you're from
            You might be the one who's running things
            Well, you could ring anybody's bell and get what you want
            You see, it's easy to ignore trouble
            When you're living in a bubble
